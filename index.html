        <br> 
        <br> My name is vaibhavi and i am 17 years old. i love reading and writing stories. I am in year 12 of school and a non medical student. 
        I want to become a data scientist someday. But i'll study business first lol. 
        Once i become a raisin and retire, i'll become a writer, finally. Life has been pretty busy lately as i am preparing for all my exams and stuff.
        But i'll do just fine. My current celebrity crush has got to be Gong Li from memoirs of a geisha or maybe sandra bullock lol idk. 
        I watched the movie Baby Driver a few days ago and it was super cool.
        Like a new crime concept, althought they did "2016 it" a bit too hard cuz some scenes are cringe. I also watched this animated series called Pantheon which was unfortunately cancelled after S2.
        Corporate Cost Cutting. SAD. Anyway, i wanna learn how to animate. Even just a little bit. Also, the guitar thats kept in front of me that's collecting more dust than I'm wiping. 
        <br> I'll keep this webpage posted. Bye for now. </p>
